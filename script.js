THIS IS A CODE BLOCK 

A block statement (or compound statement in other languages, or code block) is used to group zero or more statements.
The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets and may optionally be labelled.

/* SWITCH STATEMENTS

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

// Switch statements syntax:

switch(expression) {
    case n:
        code block
        break;
    case n:
        code block
        break;
    default:
        code block
}


switch (new Date() .getDay()) { // The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6, where Sunday = 0).
    case 0:
        day = "Sunday";
        break;
    case 1:
        day = "Monday";
        break;
    case 2:
        day = "Tuesday"
        break;
    case 3:
        day = "Wednesday"
        break;
    case 4:
        day = "Thursday"
        break;
    case 5:
        day = "Friday"
        break;
    case 6:
        day = "Saturday"
        break;
}

/*

The break Keyword

When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.

When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.

A break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.

It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.
